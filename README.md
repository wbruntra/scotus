# SCOTUS Data Visualization

This project is a React application designed to visualize voting patterns and statistics from a recent term of the Supreme Court of the United States. It provides several interactive dashboards to explore the data.

## Live Site

## Features

*   **Dashboard**: An overview of the term, including key metrics like the number of cases, decision types (unanimous, split), and vote splits.
*   **Agreement Matrix**: A heatmap showing how often each pair of justices votes together, providing insight into voting blocs.
*   **Case Explorer**: A tool to filter and search for specific cases. You can filter by the justices involved and how they voted (majority, dissent). It also provides links to the full opinions on the Supreme Court's website.
*   **Justice Statistics**: A detailed breakdown for each justice, showing the number and percentage of times they voted with the majority, in dissent, or wrote a concurring opinion.
